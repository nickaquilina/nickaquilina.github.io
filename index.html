                This site contains applications I wrote in my spare time. They are written in Python, with QT for the user interfaces.
                Application sizes are not smallish. This is due to having to bundle the Python and QT libraries in order for everyone to be able to run them. Having said that, free space should not be such an issue for most :)
                <br>
                <br>
                To use them, simply download, extract and launch the .exe file.

                All software on my site is free for use. Most of the applications are what I myself needed at one time or another...

                <br>
                If you would like to see a new application or a feature added to a current application, contact me via the contact page. The same if you encounter a bug.
                I cannot promise to answer immediately, but I will try to reply and fix the issues as soon as possible :)

                The applications section contains general use applications, like a mini web server and hash generator. The 7D2D section is for Server Manager software for the 7 Days 2 Die game..
