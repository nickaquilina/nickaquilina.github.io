## GEOG5003M - Programming for Geographical Information Analysis

Nicholas Aquilina 2021


This website itself and the code & documentation hosted within is part of the First Year of the MSc. in GIS at the University of Leeds. The website design is my work. The following tools were used:


* **Paint dotNet**
	* Used for the top Logo

* **Background Image Generator**
	* http://bg.siteorigin.com - Used to generate the tiled background images.

* **Colour Palette Generator**
	* https://coolors.co - Used to generate colour palettes.



The logo is for a domain in my possesion for the last 7 years or so, however, I have not actually updated the DNS records to redirect to the Github site for this project.

All pages on this site are simple static pages, no extra technologies are required for viewing.

Although I used Git while developing, I was not all the time as diligent as I wished to be, at committing. The final version of the code is therefore available on this website for download as a zip file.
